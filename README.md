NAME
====

head-skip-tail - provide sub versions of .head|skip|tail

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use head-skip-tail;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

This distribution provides `sub` versions of the `.head`, `.skip` and `.tail` methods on versions of Raku that do not support this in core.

If these subroutines **are** supported in core, then using this module becomes a no-op.
