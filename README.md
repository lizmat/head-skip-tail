NAME
====

head-skip-tail - provide sub versions of .head|skip|tail

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use head-skip-tail;

my @a = ^10;
say head(  4, @a);  # (0 1 2 3)
say head(*-4, @a);  # (0 1 2 3 4 5)

say skip(  4, @a);  # (4 5 6 7 8 9)
say skip(*-4, @a);  # (6 7 8 9)

say tail(  4, @a);  # (6 7 8 9)
say tail(*-4, @a);  # (4 5 6 7 8 9)
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

This distribution provides `sub` versions of the `.head`, `.skip` and `.tail` methods on versions of Raku that do not support this in core.

If these subroutines **are** supported in core, then using this module becomes a no-op.
